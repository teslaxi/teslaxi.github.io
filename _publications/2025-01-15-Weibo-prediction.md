This research presents a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling framework for social media engagement on Sina Weibo, Chinaâ€™s largest microblogging platform. The study focuses on developing an accurate prediction model for post engagement metrics, including forwards, comments, and likes, within 24 hours of publication. We propose a systematic approach to feature engineering that encompasses three key dimensions: content characteristics, temporal patterns, and user behavior profiles.
