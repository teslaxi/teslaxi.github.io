This paper is for the Shanghaitech CS181 Artificial Intelligence in 24Spring final project. We apply the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) we learned in our course to train our NER model for Fintech, which can extract named entities from financial news. However, HMM assumes that each word in the observed sentence is independent of the others, which is flawed in solving the problem of named entity recognition. Therefore, we try the Conditional Random Field (CRF) to utilize the dependency between the words in financial news.
